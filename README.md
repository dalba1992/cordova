# Complex Launch Storyboard Example

Based on [the PhoneGap Hello World template](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-template-hello-world); only `config.xml` and launch images have been changed.

The launch image used in most cases is below:

![Launch Image](./res/screen/ios/Default@2x~universal~anyany.png)

However, when a narrow viewport is used (`comany`) the following is used:

!["com any" Launch Image](./res/screen/ios/Default@2x~universal~comany.png)

Note that the photographic content in the background is cropped and scaled depending upon the device rendering it; as such, the photograph is for detail alone, and doesn't include anything critical. The logo itself is centered and kept small enough to remain visible in all supported orientations and adaptations.
